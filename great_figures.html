            Composer Hector Berlioz was a French composer, music critic, and scholar who lived from 1803 to 1869.
            Active during what is known as the "Romantic period," Berlioz contributed to the genre known as "program
            music"
            with the sympohonic work <i> Symphonie fantastique </i>. A programmatic work is one that utilizes a written
            program
            to help expand up on the meaning of (mostly) independent music. <i>Symphonie fantastique</i>, for instance,
            describes an artist's unrequited love. He has taken opium, and has a result imagines an number of
            emotionally-influenced
            scenarios. A program that the audience reads helps to shape their perception of the musical events such that
            the sounds
            help to tell an extra-musical story.

        <img class="left" class="figure" src="images/Adorno.jpg" alt="image of Theodore W. Adorno" />
        <p class="right">
            Born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1903, Theodore W. Adorno lived through two world wars and massive changes in
            western society
            that took place before he died in 1969. As a member of the Frankfurt School (a school of philospy and social
            theory), Adorno
            was the only member to contribute substatively to the field of musicology(scholarly study of music). He
            critiqued the impact of
            the medium of radio on the public and on the arts (published 1945), the state of modern art music (in 1956),
            and the social, political,
            and aesthetic ramifications of mass-mediated vernacular music(popular music). He also trained as a composer,
            studying for a time with Viennese
            composer and scholar Alban Berg.

            Living from 1867 to 1944, Amy Cheney Beach was the first successful American female composer of large-scale
            art music. In particular, her "Gaelic" Symphony
            was the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. Beach has also been celebrated for her
            work as a pianist, in particular because
            she featured her own music at a time when a successful career in music was extremely rare for a woman.

            Jean-Pierre Rampal was a french flutist. Born in 1922, taught, recorded, and performed in Europe and the
            United States until 1999. He died one year later.
            Rampal is credited with a resurgence of popularity of the flute as a solo instrument, and for creating a
            blueprint for future soloists to model their
            careers after. <b>He also did this:</b>
